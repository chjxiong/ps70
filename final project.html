        <div class="title">Environmentally Responsive Façade </div>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Research</div>
        <div class="description">
          The project focuses on the development of an environmentally responsive building façade prototype, using a micro-controlling system and data-driven machine learning techniques to regulate the mechanical operation of the façade.
          <br><br>
          Current utilization of dynamic building facades still faces several research gaps that present opportunities for further investigation and innovation. While kinetic facades hold promise in terms of energy savings and aesthetics enhancement, their widespread adoption is hindered by upfront costs and operational complexities. Conventional operation algorithms, characterized by their static nature, fails to adapt dynamically to varying environmental conditions, thereby limiting their ability to achieve optimal energy efficiency. In addition, traditional building energy simulation processes require substantial time and computational resources to construct energy models and generate precise predictive results. This inefficiency underscores the necessity for streamlined methodologies to facilitate faster decision-making and implementation of kinetic facade solutions. Moreover, the escalating frequency of extreme weather events and climate fluctuations highlights the critical imperative to develop adaptive control strategies for changing climatic conditions. These strategies must be capable of swiftly responding to dynamic weather patterns, such as temperature variations, strong winds, and intense sunlight, to optimize building performance and energy efficiency. 
          <br><br>
          Therefore, this project utilizes a data-driven machine learning method to precisely instruct the mechanical system on real-time operational parameters including optimal opening angle and duration. By harnessing real-time data and predictive analytics, this shift towards adaptive control not only enhances the indoor occupant comfort in the face of climate change but also presents opportunities for maximizing energy savings and environmental sustainability.
          <br><br>
          Comprising two principal components, the system includes a weather sensor system and a mechanical system. The weather sensors continuously collect real-time data at 5-minute intervals. This data is then utilized by the mechanical system capable of adapting its geometry in real-time response to the current weather parameters. Key considerations within this project are indoor luminance and temperature levels. Functioning as an additional layer to conventional building façades, this prototype acts as a shading structure that enhances indoor environmental comfort environmental sustainability by dynamically adjusting its configuration according to real-time weather conditions. 
          <br><br>
          The data-driven method starts with data collection with the help of various sensors that store the 5-minute interval real-time data such as temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and luminance. Additionally, building energy simulations and historical Boston weather data are also included. 
          <br><br>
          Subsequently, several machine learning models are explored for their predictive capabilities, including linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and deep learning (multilayer perceptron). Following model training, evaluation metrics including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score are employed to assess the predictive performance of each model on a validation dataset. 
          <br><br>
          After evaluating the performance of each algorithm, the deep learning model was found to predict the best results in terms of prediction accuracy. This chosen model is then deployed into the system, where it continuously receives real-time data inputs from weather sensors and predicts the optimal façade operation parameters based on the incoming data. 
          <br><br>
          The final outcomes of the machine learning processes provide with the optimized operation parameters based on a control algorithm tailored for this façade structure. These operation instructions include whether the façade should be open or closed, as well as the specifications regarding the opening angle (horizontal displacement) and duration (the length of time each unit remains static) of the individual folding components within the system.
          <br><br>
          Through systematic exploration of machine learning algorithms, the data-driven approach helps the building façade operate efficiently in response to changing environmental conditions. This strategic adjustment helps to minimize heating and cooling consumption by leveraging natural light and solar heat gain when needed most. Additionally, by maximizing sunlight exposure, the system effectively enhances natural light exposure and decreases reliance on artificial lighting, thereby lowering electricity consumption for indoor illumination. This environmentally responsive system will not only contribute to the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability but also improve thermal comforts and cost savings for building occupants.

          Deciding the material of the folding structure is quite hard. 
          Intially I tried plastic, but it requires lots of forces to be folded.
          I also considered using the vacuum paper and 
          So I ended up using the transparent paper for now.
          But I still don't like this material. It is fragile and not applicable to the building material in real life.
          I will do more research on the folding materials later.

            Idealy each unit should be driven by two motors in the same speed on the upper and lower sides, 
            but this sounds very intense in terms of electricity consumption and machine simplicity.
            So I chose to use only one motor for each folding unit for now.
            <br><br>
            The operational mechanism is similar to a conventional drawing machine, 
            wherein a threaded rod and lead screw facilitate the translation of motor rotation into precise horizontal motions. 
            The lab was facing material shortages including lead screws and brackets, but it was not hard to design and 3d print them from scratch.

            The structure moves at a deliberately slow pace, 
            making it hard to notice changes quickly. 
            While this may not seem particularly exciting for a classroom demonstration, 
            it corresponds to the real-life scenarios where kinetic facades operate at lower frequencies and velocities. 
            <br> <br>
            Each folding unit is independently powered by separate motors,
            with its own distinct speeds and travel distances tailored to their unique requirements. 
            These parameters are determined by Python machine learning outcomes, 
            which analyze optimal opening angles and durations for each unit. 
            Such individualized operation is importatn as units are situated in different locations and might have different effects on indoor environments. 
            For example, units positioned at lower levels may need to minimize direct sunlight exposure to occupants seated at study desks, thus necessitating nuanced adjustments to their movements.
